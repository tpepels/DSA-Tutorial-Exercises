# Data Structures and Algorithms Course Materials

Welcome to the repository for the Data Structures and Algorithms course. This repository contains the source code for tutorials (tut_1 to tut_5), each corresponding to a specific week of the course. Inside each tutorial directory, you will find skeleton code to help you get started with the assignments, as well as an "answers" directory containing solutions.

## Structure

- `tut_1`: Week 1 materials
- `tut_2`: Week 2 materials
- `tut_3`: Week 3 materials
- `tut_4`: Week 4 materials
- `tut_5`: Week 5 materials

Each tutorial directory contains:
- Skeleton code for the week's assignments
- An `answers` directory with solutions to the assignments

## Using This Repository

Students are encouraged to attempt all assignments independently before referring to the solutions provided in the "answers" directory. The solutions are available for verification purposes and to assist if you get stuck on a particular problem. However, engaging with the assignments directly is the best way to learn and understand the course material deeply.
